I want to be upfront: I didn't think I'd make it. When I committed to 30 days of drastically reduced phone use — no social media, no news apps, no mindless browsing, phone in a drawer after 8pm — I gave myself about a week before caving.

I made it. And I'm not going back.

Here's what happened, week by week.

## Week 1: The Phantom Limb

The first three days were genuinely awful. I reached for my phone hundreds of times — at traffic lights, waiting for the jug to boil, sitting on the couch after dinner. Each time, finding it wasn't there (or rather, finding it locked in a kitchen drawer) produced a tiny jolt of anxiety.

I'd heard people describe this, but living it was different. It wasn't just habit. It was a physical sensation, like an itch I wasn't allowed to scratch. My hand would drift to my pocket on autopilot. I'd catch myself mid-reach and feel foolish.

By day four, something unexpected happened. The reaching slowed. Not because I stopped wanting my phone, but because my brain started filling the gaps with other things. I noticed the tui in the pohutukawa outside my window — apparently it had been there for weeks. I actually tasted my morning coffee instead of drinking it while scrolling. I had a twenty-minute conversation with a neighbour I'd been politely nodding at for two years.

**What I felt:** Anxious. Twitchy. Then gradually, curious.

## Week 2: The Boredom Wave

Week two was where the boredom hit. Not the gentle, contemplative boredom people write about in wellness articles. Real, grinding, what-do-I-do-with-myself boredom.

Sunday afternoon was the worst. Rain outside. No phone. No Netflix queue to disappear into (I'd included streaming in my challenge). Just me, my flat, and several hours of nothing.

I cleaned the oven. Not because it needed cleaning (it did, but that's beside the point) — because I needed *something to do with my hands*. Then I sat down and wrote in a notebook. Not journaling, not "morning pages" — just writing. Fragments of thoughts. A half-remembered recipe. A list of places I wanted to visit.

By the end of week two, I'd read two books. Actual, physical books. I hadn't finished a book in months. I also slept better than I had in years — falling asleep in ten minutes instead of the usual forty minutes of blue-light doom scrolling.

**What I felt:** Restless. Then something I can only describe as spacious.

## Week 3: The Clarity

Week three was when the magic happened. I don't use that word lightly.

I woke up on Monday morning and my mind felt... quiet. Not empty — quiet. Like the difference between a room full of people talking over each other and a room with one person speaking clearly. My thoughts had space to develop before being interrupted by a notification, a headline, or someone else's opinion.

I started having ideas again. Not big, world-changing ideas. Small, good ones. A better way to organise my workday. A present my sister would actually love. A solution to a problem at work that I'd been grinding on for weeks — it arrived fully formed while I was making scrambled eggs.

I also noticed changes in my relationships. Without a phone to retreat into, I was actually present with people. Uncomfortably so, at first. But then beautifully so. Conversations went deeper. Silences became comfortable instead of awkward. I made eye contact more.

**What I felt:** Clear. Present. Slightly evangelical (I had to stop myself from lecturing friends about their screen time).

## Week 4: The New Normal

By week four, I wasn't counting days anymore. The challenge had become less of an endurance test and more of a lifestyle I was increasingly reluctant to abandon.

Some observations from the final stretch:

**Time expanded.** Not literally, obviously. But days felt longer in the best possible way. Where I used to arrive at 10pm wondering where the evening went, now I was getting to 8pm having cooked a proper dinner, read for an hour, gone for a walk, and still had time left over. The phone hadn't just been stealing my attention — it had been stealing my *time*, in chunks so small I never noticed.

**My attention span recovered.** By week four, I could sit and read for an hour without my mind wandering to check something. In week one, fifteen minutes had been a struggle.

**I became less reactive.** Without a constant stream of news, opinions, and outrage piped directly into my brain, I found myself responding to things more thoughtfully. Emails that would have triggered an immediate, slightly irritated reply now got a considered response an hour later. Conversations that would have annoyed me just... didn't.

**I was happier.** Not euphoric. Not transformed into some zen monk floating above it all. Just... baseline happier. Less anxious. More grounded. More myself.

## Day 31 and Beyond

I turned my phone back on at the end of day 30. Within ten minutes, I had 847 unread emails, 200+ social media notifications, and a vague, creeping sense of dread.

I turned it off again.

Here's what I kept from the challenge, now three months later:

- **Phone stays in the drawer from 8pm.** Non-negotiable. This single change improved my sleep by at least an hour.
- **No social media on my phone.** I check it on my laptop, once a day, deliberately. The apps are deleted from my phone permanently.
- **No phone at meals.** Not just dinner parties — all meals. Even eating alone.
- **Morning walks without earbuds.** Just me and whatever the birds are doing.
- **One screen-free day per month.** A full 24 hours. Phone off, laptop closed. It's become my favourite day.

I won't pretend I'm cured of anything. I still waste time on my phone some days. I still catch myself scrolling when I should be sleeping. The difference is that I *catch myself*. I notice. And I have 30 days of evidence that the alternative isn't just bearable — it's better.

If you're thinking about taking the challenge, my only advice is this: the first week is awful. The second week is hard. The third week is when you'll understand why you did it. And by the fourth week, you won't want to go back.

The ultimate luxury in 2026 isn't a holiday, a promotion, or a new gadget. It's the ability to sit in a quiet room, alone with your thoughts, and feel completely fine.

Try it. You might surprise yourself.
