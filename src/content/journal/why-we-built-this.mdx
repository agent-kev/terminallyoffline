# Why We Built This

Let's start with the obvious irony: we built a website to encourage people to stop looking at websites.

We know. We've thought about it. We still think it's worth doing.

## The honest version

This project started the way most projects start — not with a grand vision, but with a small, nagging feeling.

One of us was sitting in a café in Wellington, scrolling through Instagram, looking at photos of people doing interesting things in interesting places. And it hit: *I'm sitting in an interesting place right now, and I'm looking at a screen instead of out the window.*

That's it. That's the origin story. No corporate retreat, no market research, no "aha moment" in a Silicon Valley boardroom. Just a person in a café, realising they'd rather look at pictures of life than actually live it.

## What we noticed

Once you start paying attention to how much time you spend on your phone, you can't stop noticing. The morning reach — before you've even opened your eyes properly, your hand is already moving toward the bedside table. The meal scroll — food going cold while you thumb through content you won't remember in five minutes. The 11pm rabbit hole — "I'll just check one thing" turning into forty-five minutes of nothing.

We started talking to friends about it. Turns out, everyone felt the same way. Everyone knew they were spending too much time on their phones. Everyone felt vaguely guilty about it. And nobody was doing much about it.

The internet is full of articles about screen time statistics. There are apps that lock your phone, browsers that block websites, and productivity systems that promise to reclaim your attention. But most of them felt like treating the symptom, not the cause. The cause isn't that your phone is too accessible. It's that putting it down feels uncomfortable. And nobody was really talking about that — the discomfort. The boredom. The silence.

## Why from New Zealand?

We live in Aotearoa. If you've never been, it's the kind of place where you can drive for twenty minutes and lose cell service entirely. Where the bush is so thick the canopy blocks the sky, and the only notification is a tūī screaming from a tree.

New Zealand has a complicated relationship with the internet. We're a small country at the bottom of the world, and for a long time, the internet was how we connected with everything beyond our shores. But we also have something most places don't: easy access to genuine, uninterrupted silence. An hour's drive from any city and you're in landscape that doesn't care about your screen time.

That duality — deeply online, surrounded by offline — shaped this project. We're not anti-technology. We use the internet every day. We built this website with it. But we also know what it feels like to walk through a forest without a phone, and we think more people should try it.

## What this isn't

This isn't a company. We don't sell anything. There are no products, no courses, no masterclasses, no premium tiers. There's no "challenge" with a leaderboard and a certificate at the end.

We're not experts. We don't have PhDs in behavioural psychology or neuroscience (though we read people who do, and we'll share what we learn in the journal). We're just people who noticed that putting our phones down made us feel better, and thought others might feel the same way.

We're also not here to guilt anyone. If you spend eight hours a day on your phone and you're happy, genuinely happy, then this website isn't for you. Go in peace. But if you've got that nagging feeling — the one that says *I should probably put this down* — then maybe stick around.

## What we hope for

If this website helps one person put their phone in a drawer for an hour and discover that the world doesn't end, that's enough. If it helps someone eat a meal without scrolling, walk to the shops without earbuds, or sit on a bench and just *sit* — that's enough.

We don't need to start a movement. We don't need followers or subscribers or engagement metrics (though if you want to subscribe, we won't say no — there's a box at the bottom of every page). We just need this to exist. A quiet corner of the internet that says: *it's okay to step away. You won't miss anything important. And the things you'll find out here are worth the discomfort.*

That's it. That's why we built this.

From Aotearoa, with love and the occasional dropped signal.
