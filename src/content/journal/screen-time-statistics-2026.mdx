We're not here to lecture you. The numbers do that on their own.

Every year, the data on screen time gets worse. Not because the research is more alarming — though it is — but because the hours keep climbing. We check more often, scroll longer, and start younger. The trajectory has been consistent for over a decade, and 2026 is no exception.

Here's where things stand.

## The Global Average

The average adult now spends **6 hours and 58 minutes per day** on screens for non-work purposes, according to data compiled by DataReportal's Digital 2026 Global Overview. That's up from 6 hours 40 minutes in 2023 and just under 4 hours in 2016.

To put that in context: if you sleep for eight hours, you're spending roughly 43% of your waking life looking at a screen. Not for work. Not for learning. For scrolling, streaming, swiping, and consuming content you won't remember by morning.

Globally, we now pick up our phones an average of **96 times per day** — once every ten waking minutes. That figure, from a 2025 study by Reviews.org, represents a 25% increase since 2020. The median session lasts just over three minutes, which means most of these pickups aren't purposeful. They're reflexive. You reach, you scroll, you put it down. Ten minutes later, you do it again.

## Screen Time by Age Group

The averages disguise a distribution that, when you look at it by age, becomes significantly more concerning.

**Children (ages 8-12):** Common Sense Media's 2025 census found that tweens average **5 hours and 33 minutes** of screen time per day outside school. That's a 17% increase since their 2021 report. Much of this is driven by short-form video — TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels account for roughly 40% of total tween screen time, up from 25% in 2021.

**Teenagers (ages 13-18):** The same report puts teens at **8 hours and 39 minutes** per day. That is not a typo. American teenagers now spend more time on screens than they do sleeping. Pew Research Center's 2025 survey found that 46% of teens describe themselves as online "almost constantly," up from 24% in 2015.

**Young adults (18-29):** This demographic averages **7 hours and 22 minutes** of non-work screen time daily. They are also the group most likely to use their phone within 60 seconds of waking (78%, per a 2025 Deloitte survey) and the least likely to have a single screen-free hour during waking hours.

**Adults (30-49):** The number drops to **5 hours and 48 minutes** of non-work screen time — still more than a third of waking hours.

**Older adults (50+):** Screen time averages **4 hours and 12 minutes** per day, the lowest of any adult group, but also the fastest-growing segment. Smartphone adoption among over-65s has increased from 61% to 83% in just five years, per Pew's 2025 data.

The pattern is clear: the younger the group, the higher the screen time. And every cohort is trending upward.

## The Mental Health Correlation

Correlation is not causation. Researchers repeat this constantly, and they're right. But the correlations between screen time and mental health have become so consistent, so large, and so well-replicated that they demand attention.

The WHO's 2025 report on adolescent mental health identified excessive screen time as one of three major environmental risk factors for anxiety and depression in young people, alongside sleep deprivation and physical inactivity — both of which, the report notes, are themselves driven in part by screen use.

Jonathan Haidt's research, expanded in his 2024 book *The Anxious Generation*, documents the timeline with uncomfortable precision. Between 2010 and 2015 — the exact window in which smartphone penetration among teens went from 30% to 85% — rates of adolescent depression increased by 50%, anxiety disorders by 70%, and self-harm hospitalisations nearly doubled in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia. Multiple datasets across multiple countries show the same inflection point.

A 2025 meta-analysis published in *JAMA Pediatrics*, covering 87 studies and over 200,000 participants, found that screen time exceeding three hours per day was associated with a **25-30% increase** in the risk of depressive symptoms in adolescents. The effect was dose-dependent: each additional hour above three increased the risk further.

For adults, the picture is subtler but still present. A longitudinal study from the University of Bath, published in late 2025, followed 1,200 adults over two years and found that those who reduced recreational screen time by one hour per day reported significant improvements in mood, sleep quality, and self-reported life satisfaction — regardless of what they did with the reclaimed time.

## The Productivity Cost

The mental health data dominates headlines, but the productivity impact might be even more economically significant.

A 2025 report from the Harvard Business Review estimated that smartphone distractions cost the US economy **$1.8 trillion annually** in lost productivity. The figure includes direct time lost to non-work phone use during work hours (averaging 56 minutes per day per employee, per a RescueTime analysis) and the far larger indirect cost of attention fragmentation.

Gloria Mark, a researcher at UC Irvine who has studied workplace attention for two decades, found that after a phone interruption, it takes an average of **23 minutes and 15 seconds** to return to the original task at the same level of focus. Given that the average knowledge worker is interrupted by their phone roughly 30 times during a work day, the maths becomes grim: the interruptions themselves may only consume minutes, but the recovery time consumes hours.

Mark's research also shows that people who are frequently interrupted compensate by working faster, which leads to higher stress, more errors, and lower-quality output. The phone doesn't just steal your time. It degrades the quality of the time that remains.

## What About Sleep?

Sleep researchers have been sounding the alarm for years, and the data continues to support them.

A 2025 National Sleep Foundation survey found that 83% of adults use a screen within 30 minutes of bedtime. Among those who do, the average time to fall asleep is 42 minutes. Among those who don't, it's 18 minutes. That's a 24-minute difference every single night — nearly three hours of lost sleep per week.

The mechanism is well-documented. Blue light from screens suppresses melatonin production by up to 50%, according to research from Harvard Medical School. But it's not just the light. The content itself — the emotional activation from social media, the cognitive stimulation from scrolling, the anxiety from news — keeps the brain in a state of arousal that is fundamentally incompatible with falling asleep.

Teens are hit hardest. Forty-five percent of teenagers report waking during the night to check their phone, per Common Sense Media. The same group shows rates of chronic sleep deprivation — defined as regularly getting less than the recommended 8-10 hours — of nearly 70%.

## What the Numbers Mean for Us

There's a temptation, when faced with data like this, to either despair or dismiss. The numbers are so large, the trend so consistent, that it can feel like trying to push back against gravity. Everyone is on their phone all the time. This is just how life works now.

We don't think so.

The data tells us something important: our current relationship with screens is not working. Not for our mental health. Not for our productivity. Not for our sleep. Not for our children. The evidence is not ambiguous.

But the data also tells us something hopeful. The studies that measure what happens when people *reduce* screen time consistently show improvements — in mood, sleep, attention, and life satisfaction. The effect sizes aren't trivial. They're clinically meaningful. And they kick in faster than most people expect, often within the first week or two.

You don't need to get to zero. The research doesn't suggest that screens are inherently toxic — it suggests that the *dose* we're currently taking is. The difference between four hours of screen time and seven hours is not a minor lifestyle preference. According to the data, it's the difference between a dose that's manageable and a dose that measurably degrades your quality of life.

These are not opinions. These are numbers. And numbers don't care whether you find them convenient.

The question isn't whether the data is concerning. It's what you're going to do about it.
